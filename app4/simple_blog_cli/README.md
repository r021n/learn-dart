# Simple Blog CLI

A basic command-line interface (CLI) application built with Dart for managing simple blog posts.

## Description

This application provides a way to interact with blog posts directly from your terminal. You can perform common operations like viewing, adding, or potentially managing blog entries (depending on the implemented features).

## Prerequisites

- **Dart SDK:** You need to have the Dart SDK installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official Dart website: [https://dart.dev/get-dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

## How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and change the directory to where you have the `simple_blog_cli` project located.

    ```bash
    cd d:\coding\latihan coding\learn_dart\app4\simple_blog_cli
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    Execute the main Dart file using the `dart run` command. Assuming your main executable script is located at `bin/simple_blog_cli.dart`:

    ```bash
    dart run bin/simple_blog_cli.dart [arguments]
    ```

    - Replace `[arguments]` with any command-line arguments your application might accept (e.g., `--help`, `--list`, `--add "New Post Title"`). If the application runs interactively without initial arguments, you can just run:
      ```bash
      dart run bin/simple_blog_cli.dart
      ```

## Features (Example)

- View existing blog posts.
- Add new blog posts.
- (Add other features like update, delete, search, etc., if applicable)
